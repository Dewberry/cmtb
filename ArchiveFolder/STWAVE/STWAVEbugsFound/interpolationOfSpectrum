a bug was found months ago that was only in halfplane that caused the spectra on the nested input 
to only initiate off of one of the 3 nested spectral inputs.  this caused an uneven wave field 
in the along shore, making waves from one meter on north side to 0 meters on south side... weird
things happend:
