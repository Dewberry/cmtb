What is the coastal Model test bed?
-----------------------------------
Welcome to the Coastal Model Test Bed!!! We are *excited* you are here.  This is a project that is aimed at
**community development** for nearshore coastal collaboration.  Various models are run in real-time at the FRF
and are validated using the observation data.  All are welcome to participate, the more models we have the better
understanding we have of different models' capabilities.

For new users
-------------
Once the model setup is established and the model is run operationally, a few things are required:
  - A data share agreement: data will be shared with the community on the FRF data servers
  - A short document publishing the initial setup
  - A evolving model setup page on this website (example_)

.. _example: ModelSetups/STWAVE.html

Who's involved?
---------------
Anybody is welcome but there are currently parties involved from various academic and government agencies
including

    - United States Geologic Survey               |USGS|
    - Naval Research Laboratory                   |NRL|
    - Oregon State University                     |OSU|
    - UCSD - Scripps school of oceanography       |SIO|
    - University of Southern California           |USC|


The project is primarily funded through USACE - ERDC - CHL

Meetings
--------
Because this is a collaborative environment, participants are encouraged to join a bimonthly status call
in which code is developed and shared with the community, data products are discussed, and questions and
discussions are raised.  Reach out to get the call in information!

In addition to the bimonthly meeting, there is a yearly meeting which is scheduled this year at the ocean
sciences meeting in February 2018.
