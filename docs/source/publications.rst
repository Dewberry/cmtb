As a research opportunity the coastal model test bed seeks publications to contribute to the state of science
with the vision of identifying model deficiencies, helping to direct funding to address model deficiencies
through field deployments and in turn adding model improvements.  This is the rapid model development cycle.

Each model setup is documented through a short technote on initial deployment. those are outlined here for those
wishing to use the data.  As model setups are updated and improved, the documentation is added to the `Model Setups`
page.

Technotes are a way to disseminate initial model setups in greater detail than available through these pages.
